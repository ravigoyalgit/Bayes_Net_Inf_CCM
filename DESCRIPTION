Description: A framework to estimate parameters of a static, agent-based
    network model. Parameters of the contact network are estimated with
    the use of Bayesian inference and Congruence Class Models (CCMs) in
    order to incorporate multiple data sources (epidiological, viral
    genetic, and risk behavior survey data).
